When talking about the layout of a graph, we have to agree on how coordinates of graph elements are to be stored and interpreted. While this will change once we have a new graph structure, ELK's KGraph data structure relies on being annotated with layout data. The annotations are instances of the KLayoutData meta model, [which is documented here](http://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/confluence/x/V4EN).

Once the new data structure is complete, we will update the documentation in this wiki accordingly.
